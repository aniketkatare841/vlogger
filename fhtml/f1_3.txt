"""

Write a python program that computes the net amount of a bank account
based a transaction log from console input. The transaction log format
is shown as following: D 100 W 200 (Withdrawal is not allowed if balance
is going negative. Write functions for withdraw and deposit) D means deposit
while W means withdrawal.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: 
D 300 
D 300 
W 200 
D 100 
Then, the output should be: 500
