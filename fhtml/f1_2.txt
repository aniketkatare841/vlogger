"""
Write a python program to store marks scored in subject Fundamental of
Data Structure by N students in the class. Write functions to compute following:
a)	The average score of class 
b)	Highest score and lowest score of class 
c)	Count of students who were absent for the test
d)	Display mark with highest frequency
